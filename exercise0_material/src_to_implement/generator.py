# In this exercise task you will implement an image generator. Generator objects in python are defined as having a next function.
# This next function returns the next generated object. In our case it returns the input of a neural network each time it gets called.
# This input consists of a batch of images and its corresponding labels.

        # the batch size
        # the image size
        # flags for different augmentations and whether the data should be shuffled for each epoch
        # Also depending on the size of your data-set you can consider loading all images into memory here already.
