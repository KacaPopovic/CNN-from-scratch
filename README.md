# DeepLearningFAU

In this code I implemented every layer of Convolutional Neural Network based only on numpy. You can see those implementations in exercise1_material/src_to_implement/Layers. Different regularization techniques were also implemented, including L1, L2 norm, dropout etc. 
Thise classes were later used to define Convolutional Neural Network model and Reccurent Neural Network.
